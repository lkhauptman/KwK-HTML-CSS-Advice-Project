						<h3>Our favorite parts of camp.</h3>
						<p>School, for many, is boring. Camp, for EVERYONE (!!!) isn't. Our favorite part of camp is every part. The other 19 girls, as well as the teachers and TAs, are supportive and encouraging. No matter what, they'll be there for you, through all of your errors. Meeting these incredible young women has made a huge impact on our lives. So htat, probably, is our favorite part of camp. We also LOVE coding! We were terrified when we walked into class on the first day, and now we never ever want to leave. Eight hours seems like a lot at first, but we could stay here for eight MORE hours. Camp goes by too quickly. The food isn't half-bad either :)</p>

								<h3>Some things to know before your first day.</h3>
								<p>You will fail. A lot. And that's okay! Failure is completely normal, and even encouraged in this environment. Learning to code is tough, espeically when there is so much information condensed into only two weeks. So, fail as much as you can. Each time you get an error, you learn something new. You will also find happiness. Failure makes success even sweeter, so after lots and lots of errors, finally achieving what you set out to do is unbelievable. You're going to meet some incredible people (as we said above), and you're going to have some amazing opportunities. 'Nuff said.
